    <p>I am a professor at Dummy University. My research focuses on the interaction of algorithms and networks, and
        the roles they play in large-scale social and information systems. My work has been supported by an NSF Career
        Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a
        Simons Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, and grants from
        Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of the National Academy
        of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>
